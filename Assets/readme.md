Hi everybody,

You'll find here a little demo about how ApacheCamel does work and some leads
to help you start your first project on camel.

This is actually the demo/example that I would like to have when I started
working with ApacheCamel a year ago (july 2016).

So basically how does it works.

You've got here 3 modules :
camel-common
camel-audit
simple-fetch

camel-audit and simple-fetch are both depending from camel-common that's why
camel-common contains all the models/utils/repository/constants class.

#Pr√© requis
##RabbitMq
To run this project you should have RabbitMq installed on your machine, to install
RabbitMq, check this link : https://www.rabbitmq.com/#getstarted

Don't forget to activate the ManagementPlugin by the way : https://www.rabbitmq.com/management.html

##Config
The config.properties sample that I gave you works only on my personal computer, so you'll have to change the value (you can keep the keys of course) to make it works on yours.
For the ftp config, you'll find every thing you need here : http://camel.apache.org/ftp.html

#How to start
To start a module you just have to pass your config.properties file path
in argument, if you don't it will look at your root folder for file config.properties (useful when you just want to deploy your .jar)

For my development I'm using this path : camel-common/src/test/resources/config-dev.properties
